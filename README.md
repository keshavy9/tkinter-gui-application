# tkinter-gui-application

A basic desktop application that provides a bookstore database, that holds the data about different books like the author, ISBN number, year it was published. The application uses tkinter which is python library to make GUIs, and sqlite3 library as for the database purposes.

Sqlite3 because it can be used by a single bookstore owner which need not install any packages for database, as sqlite3 comes built in with python.
